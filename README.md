Patchie's clone of firegene-discord-bot
=================
A clone of firegene's project so i can work on it and test ideas without breaking things

## Glitch project
This version of the bot is hosted (but not kept alive) on glitch [here](https://fg-fc-bot-gitsync.glitch.me/)  
The project is automatically synced up to this repository (specifically the `master` branch)

To invite the bot to your server for testing, use this [invite link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=NDY5OTM1ODU2MjcwOTY2ODI0.Dn2OBA.O9O7b4Lj4F9LNg-h8LgXGyrex4g&scope=bot&permissions=0)  
To make him leave, use the command `!leave @MentionTheBot`
